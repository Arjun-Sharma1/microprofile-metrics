= How to run the tests

== Server under test
Start your Eclipse Microprofile Server with Metrics enabled


== Tests

*Note:* TCK is currently still under development

If the server is responding on localhost port 8080 you can just run the tests
via

[source, bash]
----
$ mvn install
----

If the server is responding on a different url/port, you can explicitly pass in the url like this:


[source, bash]
----
$ mvn install -Dtest.url=http://myServer:myPort
----
